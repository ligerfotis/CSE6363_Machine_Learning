## CSE-6363 Homework 1
___

## Description

* `data.py` file contains all the datasets and sample

* `poisson.py` implements the 1st exercise. It calculates and prints the MLE and MAP optimal Î».

* `knn.py`  implements the 2nd exercise. It prints the predictions results for the samples given and the performance of the algorithm for each k given using both all features and excluding age from them.

* `gauss_naive_bayes.py` implements the 3d exercise. It prints the predictions results for the samples given and the performance of the algorithm using both all features and excluding age from them.

#### Requirements
